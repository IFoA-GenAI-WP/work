**Description:**
Dive into the transformative world of artificial intelligence in this full-day workshop designed specifically for actuaries and insurance professionals. The session will guide you through the fundamentals of Neural Networks, including Feedforward Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs), and Transformers, before exploring the cutting-edge concepts of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other advanced techniques within Generative AI (GenAI).

Participants will gain practical experience through hands-on exercises, building classification models leveraging neural networks, and developing a mini GenAI app tailored for the insurance industry. Whether youâ€™re looking to enhance your AI skills or explore new ways AI can impact risk modeling and decision-making, this workshop will equip you with the knowledge and tools needed to integrate AI into actuarial practice.

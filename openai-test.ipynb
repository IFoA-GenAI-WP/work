      "**Image 1:**\n",
      "- The damage is located on the driver's side door.\n",
      "- There are several noticeable scratches and scuffs on the door.\n",
      "- The scratches appear to be deep enough to have removed the paint, exposing the underlying material.\n",
      "- There is no visible denting or structural damage to the door itself.\n",

      "### Estimation of Repair Costs\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the car is a Toyota, which is generally considered a mid-range brand in terms of repair costs, and considering the location (London), the following factors will influence the repair costs:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Scratch Repair and Repainting:**\n",
      "   - The scratches will need to be sanded down, filled, and repainted.\n",
      "   - The cost of repainting a door panel in London can range from £150 to £300, depending on the body shop and the quality of the paint used.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Labour Costs:**\n",
      "   - Labour costs in London are generally higher than in other parts of the UK.\n",
      "   - Expect to pay around £50 to £100 per hour for labour.\n",
      "   - The repair job might take around 2 to 4 hours, depending on the extent of the damage and the efficiency of the body shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional Costs:**\n",
      "   - If the scratches are deep and have caused any minor structural damage, additional costs might be incurred for filler material and extra labour.\n",
      "   - This could add an extra £50 to £100 to the total cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Total Estimated Cost\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Scratch Repair and Repainting:** £150 - £300\n",
      "- **Labour Costs (2 to 4 hours):** £100 - £400\n",
      "- **Additional Costs:** £50 - £100\n",
      "\n",
      "**Total Estimated Repair Cost:** £300 - £800\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a rough estimate, and actual costs may vary based on the specific body shop and any additional unforeseen damage. It is advisable to get a few quotes from different repair shops in London to get a more accurate estimate.\n"
